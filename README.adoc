== Introduction

This project demonstrates a leader election mechanism for microservices running on Kubernetes.
It ensures that only one instance of a service acts as the leader at any given time, using Kubernetes' native capabilities and Spring Cloud.

== Prerequisites

To test this example, you need:
* A Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube).
* Docker installed on your machine.
* Helm installed for Kubernetes package management.

If you're using Minikube, you also need a container registry.
Enable the registry addon with:

```
minikube addons enable registry
```

For Windows users, run the following command to configure the registry:

```
docker run --rm -it --network=host alpine ash -c "apk add socat && socat TCP-LISTEN:5000,reuseaddr,fork TCP:$(minikube ip):5000"
```

== Setup Instructions

=== Step 1: Build and Push Docker Image

A `build.bat` script is provided to simplify the image creation and pushing process.
Run the script:

```
build.bat
```

This will:
1. Build the Docker image for the application.
2. Push the image to the Minikube registry.

=== Step 2: Deploy the Application

A Helm chart is provided to deploy the application on Kubernetes.
Use the provided `deploy.bat` script to uninstall any existing deployment and install the latest version:

```
deploy.bat
```

Alternatively, you can deploy manually with Helm:

```
helm install leader-election ./leader-election
```

== How It Works

The application uses Kubernetes' native mechanisms to coordinate leadership election among pods.
* The leader is determined based on the configuration in the Helm chart.
* Spring Cloud Kubernetes manages the leadership logic.

== Testing

To verify that the application is functioning correctly:
1. Access the `/status` endpoint of any pod to see if it is the current leader.
2. Use the Kubernetes dashboard or `kubectl logs` to monitor logs and confirm leadership transitions.

== Troubleshooting

For common issues:
* Ensure the Docker image is pushed to the Minikube registry.
* Verify the `leader-election-sa` service account has appropriate RBAC permissions in Kubernetes.
